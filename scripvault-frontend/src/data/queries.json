    "response": "For retirement planning with a 20-year horizon and moderate risk, I recommend a diversified portfolio. Consider a mix of large-cap equity funds (e.g., Parag Parikh Flexi Cap Fund), balanced advantage funds (e.g., HDFC Balanced Advantage Fund), and a small allocation to debt funds. ELSS funds can also provide tax benefits under Section 80C. Regularly review your portfolio and rebalance as needed. For personalized advice, consider a detailed financial planning session.",

    "response": "Both ELSS and PPF offer tax benefits under Section 80C. ELSS funds have a 3-year lock-in and are market-linked, offering potentially higher returns but also higher risk. PPF has a 15-year lock-in, offers guaranteed returns, and is low risk. For the 30% tax bracket, if you have a higher risk appetite and longer horizon, ELSS can be good. If you prefer safety and guaranteed returns, PPF is better. A balanced approach often involves both.",

    "expertAvatar": "https://placehold.co/40x40/28a745/white?text=RK",
    "response": "For an emergency fund, liquidity is key. Liquid funds offer better liquidity and potentially slightly higher returns than traditional savings accounts, with very low risk. Fixed deposits have a lock-in period, making them less ideal for immediate access to funds. Therefore, liquid funds are generally preferred for emergency funds.",
